<details><summary><h3>👨‍💻 Jumas's Coding Journey</h3></summary> 
  From a young age, I’ve been passionate about solving problems, which naturally led me to discover Software Engineering during my final year of high school. At university, I deepened my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and software design, which solidified my interest in the field. 
  Eager to share my knowledge, I became a teaching assistant for "Algorithms and Programming 2," refining my communication skills and reinforcing my grasp of the subject. I also tutored students worldwide through Tutor.com, further enhancing my problem-solving and teaching abilities.
  Participating in hackathons, such as HackITBA, was eye-opening: working under pressure, collaborating with people from different backgrounds, and solving problems quickly—all of that helped me grow both technically and personally.
  Thanks to these experiences, I have been able to lead and contribute to ambitious projects such as distributed systems for restaurants, platforms for managing soccer fields, web apps for scouting football players and even a remake of the classic game Jazz Jackrabbit 2 developed as a group project during my time at university. Each project has brought new challenges, allowing me to work with technologies like Rust, Java, C++, React, and more. One of the most challenging and rewarding experiences was developing a full-stack Spotify-like mobile application, including a complete backoffice system. The project involved designing APIs, handling authentication, managing media-related data, and building administrative tools for content and user management. This experience strengthened my understanding of end-to-end system design, scalability concerns, and the importance of clean architecture across both frontend and backend.
  Nowadays, I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as an engineer, collaborate with passionate people, and create solutions that truly make a difference.
